                    <p>
                        If you are sick, <span class="bold">do not report to school</span> for the exam. Get a MC on the same day and submit it to the Admin Office within 48 hours of the exam (use the email address above).

                        <p>
                            If you have COVID, you do not need to get a MC. Instead, do an ART self-test, take a picture of the positive test with your name and the date written on the kit and send it to the Admin Office.

                    <p>
                        If you are caught in a train disruption, <span class="bold">inform the Admin Office immediately</span> and continue making your way to school. Make sure you tell the Admin Office what time you expect to arrive (or at least where you are) too.

                        If you are stuck in traffic due to a flood, <span class="bold">inform the Admin Office immediately</span> and continue making your way to school. Make sure you tell the Admin Office where you are too.

            <p>
                Note that for exams, <span class="bold">an MC is the only valid reason for absence</span>. If you are late for the exam for any reason besides a train disruption or flooding, you will not be given extra time to complete the paper.

                    <p>
                        You must wear proper school attire for exams. <span class="bold">Failure to do so can result in getting zero marks for the exam</span>.
